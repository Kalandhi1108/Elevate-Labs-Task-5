# Elevate-Labs-Task-5

Objective : Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types.

Tool: Wireshark 

Step 1 - Install  Wireshark
I  understand how to set up a packet analysis tool on your system.

Step 2 - Start capturing on your active network interface.
Learn to identify which network interface is currently handling your internet traffic.

Step 3 - Browse a website or ping a server to generate traffic
example : www.google.com

Step 4 - Stop capture after a minute.
You control the capture window to avoid collecting excessive data.

Step 5 -  Filter captured packets by protocol (e.g., HTTP, DNS, TCP,UDP)
  http for web traffic

dns for domain lookups

tcp for connection-oriented communication

udp for connectionless -oriented communication

Step 6 - Export the capture as a .pcap file

Step  - 7 Summarize 
During the capture, protocols including DNS, TCP, HTTP, and UDP were detected. DNS traffic handled domain name lookups, TCP managed reliable data transfer for web requests, HTTP carried website content, and UDP supported faster, connectionless communication such as certain application or service queries. Packet details showed clear source and destination IP addresses, associated port numbers, and timestamps, allowing the identification of browsing activity and other network interactions.

Skills Gained:

-->Hands-on use of Wireshark

-->Understanding of network protocols & packet structure

-->Ability to filter and interpret network traffic

-->Knowledge of exporting and documenting packet captures
